# Description
This is a simple menu for git. In this git menu, the most used commands are simplifyed to the max. we just call for the git menu using "G" and then an option like "3". At your terminal if you type "$G 3" gitMenu will execute the option 3 of the list. (to see the full list, just type "$G" at the terminal)

The reason why with script is very usefull is because the author codes a lot on the smartphone. Every change is commited even before the feature is ready. This script aids the developer on the heavy need for sync between machines.
This app sends commands more with simbols rather than text, to aave keystrokes.
