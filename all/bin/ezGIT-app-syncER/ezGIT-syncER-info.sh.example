# Use: Copy this file to your chosen repository; Rename it to remove the extention .example; Change the variable names inside the copy of this file; Define an alias in the system to execute this file; This file will tell ezGIT what repos to sync and finally will run the sync
  # This script is for those repositories that in such repo, you mainly use one file

# Change these values according to user-specific repos/infos/choosen nick/choosen files to make use of
   # In case you are Dv (the user Dv) the repo name and location is:
      v_choosen_repo="name-of-repository-here"

   # User name (for a prety presentation):

   # Chosen file to edit whitin the repo:

   # Relative repository path to load:
      #v_choosen_repo_path=$(pwd)  ## It cannot be using 'pwd' instead, it must detect the script location
      v_choosen_repo_path="${v_REPOS_CENTER}/DRYA"  ## Instead, we can define it by hand
      

   # This path must exist for the rest to run
   #    ${v_REPOS_CENTER}/$v_choosen_repo/$v_choosen_file

      echo $v_choosen_repo
