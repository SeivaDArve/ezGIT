# About encryption:
   This README.md file sits side-by-side with 2 directories "encrypted" + "decrypted"
      ONLY ONE CAN HAVE FILES AT A TIME

   When encryption is performed, the directory "encrypted" is populated
      and the contents of "decrypted" are deleted

   If you find files at both directories at a time, there is a bug

# Mothod of encryption used (for testing)
   simetric encryption is tested on ezGIT

   Please do not contribut with sensitive date to ezGIT because this encryption is only for testing and applying on other repositories
